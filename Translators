Contributing:
=============

If you would like to contribute to the pt_BR translation effort, just visit
http://www.php.net/cvs-php.php and fill out the form to request a CVS 
account to be able to actually modify the files to the main file repository.
Remember to write on the 'Purpose' field that you want to help on the
translation of the manual to portuguese.

Since the pt_BR translation effort was virtually dead for about 6 months,
we removed all the files from the pt_BR tree so we can have all the updated
files from the main tree (english one). If you wish to translate the other
files that are not being translated by another user, please copy the 'original'
file from the '/phpdoc/en/' repository to your local '/phpdoc/pt_BR/' copy.

There is an informal step by step help on how to help on the portuguese
translation on the following URL: http://phpbrasil.com/traducao.php
There is also a new portuguese speaking mailing list for helpers and the team
on the pt_BR translation as the official phpdoc@lists.php.net is not always the
best place to ask for very trivial questions. The URL for this new mailing can
be found here: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/traducao-php
